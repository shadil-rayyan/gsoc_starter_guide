## 1️⃣ What is a GitHub Profile?

Your **GitHub profile** is like your **online resume for coding**.

When someone opens your GitHub link (like this one of yours):
👉 `https://github.com/shadil-rayyan`

They can see:

* Your **name & photo**
* Your **projects (repositories)**
* Your **skills**
* How active you are (green contribution boxes)

👉 Companies, teachers, and other developers look at this.

## 2️⃣ What is a GitHub Profile README?

A **Profile README** is a **special page** that appears **at the top of your GitHub profile**.

It can show:

* Who you are
* What you are learning
* Your skills (HTML, CSS, Python, etc.)
* GitHub stats
* Contact info

### Example:

When people open your profile, they see a **custom introduction** instead of a blank page.

## 3️⃣ How Does GitHub Know This Is Your Profile README?

GitHub shows a README **ONLY IF**:

✅ You create a repository
✅ The repository name is **EXACTLY your username**

For you:

```
Username: shadil-rayyan
Repository name: shadil-rayyan
```

⚠️ Spelling must match **100%**

# Are You Good Enough for GSoC?

### Short answer: **Yes, if you meet the basics and put in effort.**

You **do NOT need to be an expert**.

## What You Actually Need

### 1️⃣ You Do Not Need to Be an Expert

* GSoC is a **learning program**, not a senior engineer role
* Mentors expect you to learn during the program
* Many selected students start with limited experience

What matters more:

* willingness to learn
* consistency
* communication

---

### 2️⃣ Basic Programming Knowledge Is Enough

You should be comfortable with:

* one programming language
* basic data structures
* reading and understanding existing code

You don’t need:

* advanced algorithms
* deep system knowledge (unless the org requires it)

---

### 3️⃣ Git and GitHub Are Non-Negotiable

You **must** know:

* cloning repositories
* creating branches
* making commits
* opening pull requests
* responding to reviews

This is essential for **any** open-source work.

---

### 4️⃣ Tech Stack Depends on the Organization

* Each organization uses different tools and languages
* You don’t need to know everything in advance
* You should be willing to learn what the org uses

Choose orgs where:

* you know some of the stack
* the rest is learnable

### 5️⃣ Many First-Time Contributors Get Selected Every Year

* You do **not** need prior GSoC experience
* New contributors are selected every year
* Mentors value **fresh but reliable contributors**

What they look for:

* effort
* learning ability
* proof you can finish work

## The Real Question Mentors Ask

> “Is this person reliable and capable of completing the project?”

Not:

* “Are they the smartest?”
* “Do they know everything already?”

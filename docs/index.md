## 👤 About Me

Hello everyone 👋
My name is **Shadil A M**, and I am a **4th-year Computer Science Engineering (CSE) student** from **KTU University**.

I was selected as a **Google Summer of Code (GSoC) 2025 Contributor** with the open-source organization **Zendalona**.

During GSoC, I worked on **zMantra**, a **math learning game designed for visually impaired students**.
This project was not just about writing code — it focused heavily on **accessibility, research, and real-world impact**.

As part of this work, I:

* Visited **blind schools**
* Interacted with **real users**
* Collected feedback directly from visually impaired students
* Improved the product based on actual user needs

This experience taught me that **good software is not just functional, but inclusive**.

I am also the **founder of CodeCompass**, an **open-source platform built for students**, where beginners can learn, explore open source, and grow together.

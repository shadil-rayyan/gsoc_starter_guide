# How to Prepare for GSoC Before Proposal Season

### 1️⃣ Start Early

* Begin contributing **well before the proposal season**.
* Explore the organization’s code, issues, and community.
* Early contributions make you **visible to mentors**.

---

### 2️⃣ Become a Known Contributor

* Participate in chats, discussions, and mailing lists.
* Help other newcomers and answer questions if you can.
* Your consistent presence **builds trust**.

---

### 3️⃣ Prioritize Meetings Over Chats

* **Meetings with mentors** are stronger signals than casual chats.
* Schedule short calls or voice/video meetings to discuss ideas.
* Mentors notice students who actively **seek guidance**.

---

### 4️⃣ Build Prototypes Early

* A working prototype or small demo is **more persuasive than promises**.
* Share prototypes before the application deadline.
* Mentors use this as proof that **you can actually implement your project**.

---

### 5️⃣ Gather Evidence, Not Just Confidence

* Accepted pull requests, small contributions, or test fixes **count more than self-confidence**.
* Show clear proof that you can **finish tasks reliably**.

---

### 6️⃣ Contact Previous Contributors

* Reach out to past GSoC students for tips and guidance.
* They can help you **understand the project better** and avoid common mistakes.

---

### 7️⃣ Be Consistent and Communicate Clearly

* Contribute regularly, not just in bursts.
* Ask clear, specific questions.
* Update mentors on progress and issues.

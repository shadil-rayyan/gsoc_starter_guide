# How to Contribute to a GSoC Organization (After Choosing One)

## First: Understand This Clearly

❌ GSoC is **not** about the number of PRs
✅ GSoC is about **useful, trusted contributions**

> **5 bad PRs = zero value**
> **2–3 good PRs = very strong signal**

---

## What Counts as a “Good” Contribution?

A good contribution:

* solves a **real problem** the org cares about
* is **reviewed and merged**
* follows project standards
* shows understanding of the codebase

This is what mentors look for.

# Step-by-Step: How Contribution Actually Works

---

## 1️⃣ Start by Understanding the Project’s Problems

Before coding:

* read open issues
* read discussions
* ask mentors:

  > “What problems need help right now?”

Best contributors **solve pain points**, not random tasks.

---

## 2️⃣ Pick the Right Issues (Very Important)

### Good issues for GSoC contributors:

* `good first issue`
* `help wanted`
* small bugs
* documentation gaps
* test failures
* performance issues

Avoid initially:

* huge refactors
* core architecture changes
* unclear tasks

---

## 3️⃣ Talk Before You Code

Before starting an issue:

* comment on it
* explain your approach briefly
* ask if you can take it

This prevents:

* duplicate work
* wasted effort

Mentors appreciate this.

---

## 4️⃣ Make Thoughtful Pull Requests (PRs)

### What a strong PR looks like:

* focused on **one problem**
* clean commits
* follows style guide
* includes tests (if required)
* explains **why**, not just what

---

## 5️⃣ Handle Reviews Like a Pro

Reviews are normal.

Good behavior:

* respond politely
* fix issues quickly
* ask clarifying questions
* don’t argue emotionally

How you handle review matters **as much as the code**.

---

## 6️⃣ How Many PRs Are “Enough”?

### Realistic truth:

* **2–3 strong PRs** → good chance
* **4–5 solid PRs** → very strong
* **10+ tiny PRs** → suspicious / low value

Mentors prefer:

> fewer, meaningful contributions

---

## 7️⃣ Non-Code Contributions Also Matter

These count if they are useful:

* improving documentation
* fixing build/setup issues
* adding tests
* helping users in discussions
* reviewing PRs

Especially good early contributions.

---

## 8️⃣ Show Consistency (Not a One-Time Spike)

Better:

* small contributions every week

Worse:

* many PRs in one week, then silence

Consistency builds trust.

---

## 9️⃣ Solve Problems They Actually Face

Ask questions like:

* “Is this issue blocking a release?”
* “Is this something users complain about?”
* “Can I improve this workflow?”

Solving **real pain** makes you memorable.

---

## 10️⃣ Connect Contributions to Your Proposal

Later, in your proposal:

* reference your PRs
* explain what you learned
* show how your project builds on this work

This makes your proposal believable.

---

# How the Contribution Phase “Works” (Mentor View)

Mentors evaluate:

* reliability
* communication
* learning speed
* problem-solving
* collaboration

Not just code.

# Understanding Projects in GSoC (After Organization Announcement)

---

## 1️⃣ What a GSoC Project Actually Is

A **project** is:

* A **specific task or feature** the organization wants to implement or improve.
* Something that can be **finished in the GSoC coding period** (usually 12–14 weeks).
* Usually part of an **existing open-source software**.

Examples:

| Organization | Project Example                                |
| ------------ | ---------------------------------------------- |
| Mozilla      | Add a new feature to Firefox DevTools          |
| Django       | Improve the admin interface                    |
| TensorFlow   | Build a demo or optimization for ML models     |
| Linux        | Fix a specific driver bug or improve a utility |

> A project is **not the whole software** — it’s a focused piece you can realistically complete.

## 2️⃣ Where to See Project Ideas

After orgs are announced (usually February):

### **a) Organization Website**

* Most orgs list **“GSoC project ideas”**.
* Example sections: “Ideas for Students”, “GSoC 2026 ideas”, or “Contribute”.

### **b) GitHub Repositories**

* Check the org’s repositories.
* Look for issues labeled:

  * `good first issue`
  * `help wanted`
  * `GSoC idea`
* Read the issue description carefully; this can be your project.

### **c) Previous GSoC Projects**

* Look at **past years’ GSoC projects** for inspiration.
* Often, you can **extend or improve** a previous project.

### **d) Community Channels**

* Discord, Slack, mailing lists, GitHub Discussions
* Mentors sometimes **hint at ideas not publicly listed yet**.

## 3️⃣ How to Choose the Right Project

Ask yourself:

1. **Interest & Passion**

   * Will you enjoy working on this for 3+ months?

2. **Skill Match**

   * Do you know some of the technologies?
   * Can you learn the rest in 2–3 months?

3. **Feasibility**

   * Is it realistic to finish in the coding period?

4. **Mentor Support**

   * Are there active mentors to guide you?

5. **Contribution Opportunity**

   * Can you start contributing before submitting your proposal?

> **Tip:** Early contributions (bugs, docs, tests) related to the project make your proposal much stronger.

## 4️⃣ Optional: Proposing a New Project Idea

Some organizations allow students to **propose their own idea**, but only if:

* It aligns with the organization’s goals.
* It solves a **real problem**.
* You can explain **how you will implement it and why it matters**.

**How to do it:**

1. Contact the mentor or ask in the community.
2. Draft a small plan:

   * Problem you want to solve
   * How it improves the project
   * Rough steps for implementation

> Mentors will evaluate whether your idea is **realistic and useful**.

# How Organizations Select Contributors

GSoC organizations need to choose **students they can trust to finish a project**. They cannot pick randomly — they have to justify their choices to Google, because **hundreds of students apply for few slots**.

Here’s what they evaluate:

### 1️⃣ Proof That You Can Finish the Project

* Mentors look for **evidence that you can complete tasks**.
* This comes from small, real contributions like pull requests or bug fixes.
* They ask themselves: *“Has this person shown they can finish what they start?”*

---

### 2️⃣ Accepted Pull Requests Matter

* Merged PRs show you can write **real, usable code**.
* One meaningful PR is more valuable than many small cosmetic ones.
* The type of PR depends on the org:

  * Some orgs value **code contributions**
  * Others also count **documentation, tests, or setup improvements**

---

### 3️⃣ Good Communication and Regular Meetings

* Mentors need to know you **won’t disappear halfway**.
* Regular updates, clear questions, and attending meetings show reliability.
* Silence or delayed responses can quickly reduce your chance of selection.

---

### 4️⃣ Clear and Feasible Proposals

* Proposals must be realistic and achievable in the coding period.
* Mentors prefer proposals that **connect to previous contributions**.
* A clear proposal shows planning and understanding of the project.

# How Selection REALLY Works (Mentor Perspective)

GSoC selection is **progressive** — it’s not just about the proposal. Mentors observe your **behavior in the months before submission**.

* **Chat / discussions** → indicates interest
* **Meeting with mentors** → shows you are serious
* **Prototype / small working solution** → earns trust
* **Silence or inactivity** → usually means rejection

> Basically, mentors select students they already **trust and have seen work reliably**.

---

# Previous Contributions Depend on the Organization

* Different organizations value contributions differently:

  * Some want **several small PRs**
  * Some prefer **one or two deep, meaningful contributions**
  * Some accept **non-code contributions** like documentation, tests, or reviews
* Always observe the organization’s norms before contributing.

---

# What Mentors Actually Look For

When deciding who to select, mentors ask themselves:

1. **Can this student finish the project?**

   * Have they shown reliability in prior contributions?

2. **Will they disappear midway?**

   * Do they communicate regularly?

3. **Do they communicate clearly?**

   * Can they explain problems, ask questions intelligently, and respond to feedback?

4. **Do we trust this person?**

   * Trust is built over time, through contributions, discussions, and prototypes.

### ✅ Key Insight

> **Selection is not random.**
> Mentors prefer students they **already know, have seen contribute, and can rely on**.
> Your **PRs, communication, and early engagement** are more important than the proposal alone.

A **slot** is basically a **position for a student** in GSoC.

* Each slot means **one student can be accepted** to work with that organization.
* If an organization has **5 slots**, they can accept **5 students**.
* Each slot corresponds to **one approved project**.

Think of it like **tickets** for a concert — only students with a “slot” can participate officially.

# How Many Slots Does an Organization Have?

* Google decides **how many slots each organization gets every year**.

* The number varies depending on:

  1. **Past participation** – if the org successfully mentored students before, it usually gets more slots.
  2. **Mentor availability** – more active mentors = more slots.
  3. **Organization capacity** – how many projects they can realistically support.
  4. **Project quality and size** – big, complex projects may reduce slots.

* Typical range: **2–20+ slots**, but some large orgs can get more.

> Example:
>
> * Mozilla Firefox: 15 slots
> * Django: 5 slots
> * Small org: 2 slots

# How Google Gives Slots to Organizations

1. **Organizations apply in January**

   * They submit their history, number of mentors, project ideas, past performance.

2. **Google evaluates**:

   * Success of past students
   * Number of mentors available
   * Capacity to guide students
   * Quality of proposed projects

3. **Slots are assigned**

   * Once announced in February, the organization **knows how many students they can select**.

> Important: **Organizations cannot exceed the slots given by Google.**
> So even if 20 students want to work with an org with only 5 slots, **only 5 can be selected**.

# Why Slots Matter

* It determines **how competitive an org is**.
* Few slots → more competition, harder to get in.
* Many slots → slightly higher chances, but still depends on **your contributions and proposal**.

> Tip: Don’t only look at slot numbers — small orgs with fewer slots can be easier if you contribute early and show trust.

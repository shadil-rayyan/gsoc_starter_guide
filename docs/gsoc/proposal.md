# What Is a GSoC Proposal?

A **proposal** is your **formal application to work on a project for GSoC**.

* It explains **what you want to do**, **how you will do it**, and **why you are capable**.
* Think of it as a **project plan + proof of ability + roadmap**.
* Unlike pull requests, a **proposal is evaluated for feasibility and trust**, not just coding skill.

> In short: **a strong proposal can matter more than 5–10 PRs**.

# Why Do We Write a Proposal?

1. **Communicate your plan** to mentors.
2. **Show feasibility**—you know what can realistically be done in the coding period.
3. **Demonstrate trust**—mentors see that you can organize and finish a project.
4. **Convince the committee** why you should get a GSoC slot over hundreds of applicants.

# Where to Apply

* Applications are submitted on the **GSoC portal**:
  [https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/)
* After organization announcement, you can submit proposals to **the orgs you chose/forked**.

---

# How Many Proposals Can You Submit?

* **Up to 3 proposals per student**.
* Recommended: focus on **1–2 strong proposals**, not 3 weak ones.
* Quality > quantity.

---

# When Can You Edit Your Proposal?

* You can **edit your proposal until the submission deadline** (usually mid-April).
* After the deadline, **you cannot upload a new proposal**—only minor corrections may be allowed for formatting.

> Tip: Don’t wait until the last day—mentors may give feedback during the community bonding phase.

# Common Questions About Proposals

### Why do some organizations collect proposals early?

* They may ask for **early drafts before the portal opens**.
* Purpose:

  * Mentor meetings to discuss feasibility
  * Early feedback to improve the proposal
  * Pre-selection discussions
* Early submission shows **seriousness and commitment**.

# What a Good Proposal Should Contain

1. **Title** – short, clear, and specific
2. **Abstract / Summary** – 2–3 sentences explaining what you will do
3. **Benefits to the community** – why your project matters
4. **Deliverables / Milestones** – divide the project into achievable steps
5. **Timeline** – weekly or bi-weekly plan
6. **Technical details / approach** – how you will implement it
7. **Qualifications / Experience** – skills, PRs, previous contributions
8. **References / Links** – prototype, demos, documentation

> Optional: link to a **working prototype or demo** at the top.
> Mentors should understand your project **within 30 seconds**.

---

# Proposal Writing – Reality

* **Follow the organization’s template strictly** – they often reject proposals that ignore formatting.
* **Length:** 6–8 pages (more is not better).
* **Prototype/Demo link:** very helpful to show practical understanding.
* **Clarity matters more than fancy language**.

> Example: Instead of “I will improve the system”, write:
> “I will implement feature X by adding module Y, which will reduce setup time by Z%.”

# How Organizations Review Proposals

1. **Committee of mentors reviews all submissions**
2. **Internal discussion:** mentors debate feasibility, student reliability, and prior contributions
3. **Selection criteria:**

   * Feasibility (can the project be completed?)
   * Trust (can the student deliver?)
   * Prior interaction (PRs, prototype, discussions)
4. **Direct communication helps** – asking clarifying questions or discussing your idea can increase trust
5. **Demonstrated effort matters more than ideas alone** – mentors prefer students who have already contributed or built a prototype.

Here is a **clean, clear, and professional version** of your last points, integrated smoothly with the proposal section. This is written so you can **add it directly at the end of your guide**.

## Get Your Proposal Reviewed (Very Important)

### 1️⃣ Ask Mentors to Review Your Proposal

* If possible, **share your draft with the project mentors**.
* Mentors know:

  * what the organization actually expects
  * what scope is realistic
  * what usually gets accepted or rejected
* Even small feedback from a mentor can **greatly improve your proposal**.

---

### 2️⃣ Ask Previous GSoC Contributors for Review

* Reach out to **past GSoC contributors** from the same organization.
* They have:

  * already gone through the selection process
  * experience with proposal evaluation
* They often point out **missing details** or unrealistic timelines.

---

### 3️⃣ Review and Improve Your Proposal Regularly

* Don’t write your proposal once and submit it.
* Revise it **every week if possible**:

  * clarify goals
  * refine milestones
  * simplify explanations
* Each revision should make the proposal **clearer and more realistic**.

---

### 4️⃣ Always Base the Proposal on Real Contributions

* Proposals are strongest when based on:

  * accepted pull requests
  * real issues you worked on
  * prototypes you built
* Reviewers trust proposals more when they see:

  > “This person already understands the project.”

---

### 5️⃣ Share Your Proposal Link Properly

* When sharing your proposal (for review or feedback):

  * provide a **clean, readable link**
  * include context (project name, org, status)
  * mention what kind of feedback you want

**Example message:**

> “Hi, this is my draft GSoC proposal for <Project Name>.
> I’d appreciate feedback on scope, feasibility, and clarity.”

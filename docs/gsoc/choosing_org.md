# Choosing a GSoC Organization **Before** Org Announcement

### (Only the Choosing Factors)

Before organizations are officially announced, you are **not selecting a confirmed GSoC org**.
You are selecting a **potential open-source organization** that is *likely* to participate and *right* for you.

---

## The Only Factors You Should Use to Choose an Org

### 1️⃣ Your Genuine Interest (Non-Negotiable)

Ask:

* Do I actually like what this project does?
* Would I work on this even **without GSoC**?

Why this matters:

* GSoC lasts months
* mentors notice fake interest very quickly

If the answer is no → don’t choose it.

---

### 2️⃣ Technology Match (Reality, Not Dreams)

Choose an org where:

* you already know **some** of the stack
* you can learn the rest in 2–3 months

Avoid choosing based on:

* hype
* “this will look good on resume”
* “everyone applies here”

---

### 3️⃣ Project Activity Level

Check:

* commits in last 1–2 weeks
* issues being answered
* PRs being merged

Active project = alive mentors = real guidance.

Inactive project = high risk.

---

### 4️⃣ Contribution Friendliness

Look for:

* CONTRIBUTING.md
* setup instructions
* beginner issues
* welcoming tone in discussions

If onboarding is painful, selection will be painful.

---

### 5️⃣ Mentorship Signals

Good signs:

* maintainers reply to questions
* community chats exist (Slack/Discord)
* previous contributors still active

You are choosing **mentors**, not just code.

---

### 6️⃣ Past GSoC Participation (Strong Signal)

Prefer orgs that:

* participated in GSoC before
* have public blogs or reports
* accepted multiple contributors

Not mandatory, but **much safer**.

---

### 7️⃣ Problem Space, Not Just Features

Choose orgs where:

* problems are clear
* work can be broken into milestones
* progress can be measured

Avoid orgs where work is:

* vague
* “research-only”
* poorly defined

---

### 8️⃣ Size & Competition Level

Bigger orgs:

* more slots
* more competition

Smaller orgs:

* fewer slots
* higher visibility

Choose where **you can stand out**, not where everyone applies.

---

### 9️⃣ Long-Term Value (Beyond GSoC)

Ask:

* Can I keep contributing after GSoC?
* Would this help my career path?

Best orgs:

* benefit you even if you don’t get selected

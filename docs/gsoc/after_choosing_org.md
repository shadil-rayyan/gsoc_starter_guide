## What to Do After Choosing an Organization (Before Contributing)

### 1️⃣ Join the Organization’s Communication Channels

* Join their **Discord, Slack, Matrix, or IRC**
* Subscribe to **mailing lists**
* Follow **GitHub Discussions** and Issues

This is where real communication happens.

---

### 2️⃣ Read Documentation First (Very Important)

Before asking anything:

* Read the **README**
* Read **CONTRIBUTING.md**
* Check setup guides and FAQs

Asking questions already answered in docs creates a bad first impression.

---

### 3️⃣ Observe Before Speaking

* Watch how maintainers communicate
* See how issues and PRs are discussed
* Understand the project’s tone and expectations

This helps you fit into the community smoothly.

---

### 4️⃣ Introduce Yourself Properly

When introductions are allowed:

* your background
* your skills
* your interest in the project
* your availability (especially for GSoC)

Keep it short and honest.

---

### 5️⃣ Engage in Discussions Thoughtfully

* Participate in GitHub Discussions
* Join mailing list conversations
* Ask **specific, well-researched questions**

Quality interaction matters more than quantity.

---

### 6️⃣ Help Other Newcomers

* Answer beginner questions if you know the answer
* Share setup tips
* Point people to documentation

This shows community mindset and leadership.

---

### 7️⃣ Attend Community Meetings (If Available)

* Join weekly or monthly calls
* Listen even if you don’t speak much
* Learn project direction and priorities

Mentors often notice regular attendees.

---

## Key Rule to Remember

> **First become a community member.
> Contributions come after.**

---

## What This Phase Builds

* trust
* visibility
* understanding
* mentor recognition

All of these matter **before** your first PR.

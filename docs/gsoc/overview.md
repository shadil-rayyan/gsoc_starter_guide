## What Is Google Summer of Code (GSoC)?

Google Summer of Code (GSoC) is a **global open-source mentorship program** started by **Google in 2005**.

Its main goal is **not money, not internships, and not certificates**.

The real goal of GSoC is to:
- Help **open-source organizations**
- Train **new contributors**
- Build **long-term open-source developers**

In simple words:
> GSoC pays beginners to learn open source **properly**, under mentorship.

---

## Why Does GSoC Exist?

Before GSoC:
- Open-source projects struggled to find new contributors
- Beginners didn’t know how to start
- Students had time but no guidance
- Organizations lost contributors after short periods

Google created GSoC to solve this problem.

### GSoC exists to:
- Bring **new contributors** into open source
- Provide **structured mentorship**
- Reduce contributor drop-out
- Support open-source sustainability

Google benefits because:
- Open source powers Google’s infrastructure
- Strong open source = strong internet ecosystem

---

## What GSoC Is (And What It Is NOT)

### GSoC IS:
- A **mentorship program**
- A **learning experience**
- A **real-world open-source project**
- A **long-term contributor pipeline**

### GSoC IS NOT:
- An internship replacement
- A guaranteed job offer
- Only about coding
- A shortcut to success

---

## What Happens in GSoC?

- You work on a **real open-source project**
- You are guided by **experienced mentors**
- Your work is reviewed publicly
- You communicate regularly with the community
- You become a trusted contributor

---

## How Long Is GSoC?

GSoC duration depends on project size:

- **12 weeks** (short)
- **22 weeks** (long)

But in reality:
> You start months before selection and often continue after completion.

---

## Evaluation and Feedback

GSoC has **two formal evaluations**:

### Midterm Evaluation (45%)
- Are you making consistent progress?
- Are milestones being met?
- Are you communicating regularly?
- Are mentors satisfied?

Failing midterm usually means **program termination**.

---

### Final Evaluation (55%)
- Did you complete the project goals?
- Is the code merged or usable?
- Is documentation complete?
- Can the organization maintain your work?

Passing final means **successful completion**.

---

## What Evaluators Actually Care About

Evaluations are **not about perfection**.

Mentors evaluate:
- Consistency
- Communication
- Effort
- Reliability
- Willingness to learn

Missing deadlines **without communication** is the biggest red flag.

---

## Common Reasons People Fail GSoC

- Disappearing for days or weeks
- Poor communication
- Over-promising in proposals
- Not asking for help
- Treating GSoC like a job instead of a learning program

---

## Life After GSoC

After GSoC:
- Many contributors become long-term maintainers
- Some get job offers
- Some continue as volunteers
- Some become mentors in future years

The real reward is:
> Open-source credibility + experience + network

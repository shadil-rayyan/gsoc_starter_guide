## When Should You Start Preparing for GSoC 2026?

### **Minimum Start Time: February (After Organization Announcement)**

If your **only goal is GSoC 2026**, then **you must start at least in February**, right after the organizations are announced.

Starting later than this **greatly reduces your chances**.

---

## Why February Is the Minimum

### 1️⃣ Everyone Who Knows the Program Starts Then

* People who understand GSoC well begin immediately after orgs are announced
* Mentors expect new contributors from this time

---

### 2️⃣ Organizations Start Engaging Early

* Mentors begin:

  * assigning meetings
  * answering questions
  * noticing active contributors
* Early contributors get more attention and guidance

---

### 3️⃣ You Need Time to Build Proof

Selection is based on **evidence**, not promises.

You need time to:

* make real contributions
* get PRs merged
* show consistent activity
* build trust with mentors

---

### 4️⃣ Building a Prototype Takes Time

Strong applicants usually show:

* a small prototype
* design documents
* early implementation ideas

You cannot build this in a few weeks.

---

### 5️⃣ The Learning Curve Is Real

Open-source projects have:

* large codebases
* new tools
* strict contribution rules

You need time to:

* understand the project
* make mistakes
* improve your contributions

---

## Best Strategy (Highest Success Rate)

### ⭐ Start **Before** Organization Announcement (Best Case)

The **best approach** is to:

* identify potential organizations **months before February**
* start learning their tech stack
* read their documentation
* make small contributions early

When orgs are announced:

* mentors already know you
* you already understand the codebase
* your proposal is much stronger

---

## Simple Rule to Remember

> **February is the minimum.
> Earlier is always better.**

If you start:

* **Before February** → very strong position
* **In February** → real chance
* **In March** → risky
* **In April** → very unlikely

---

## Final Advice

If GSoC 2026 is your priority:

* don’t wait for official announcements
* pick a few orgs early
* start contributing as soon as possible

> **GSoC rewards preparation, not last-minute effort.**

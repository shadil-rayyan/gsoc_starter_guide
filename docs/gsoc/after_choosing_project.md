# Steps After Choosing a Project

Once you have **selected a project**, here’s what you should do next:

---

### 1️⃣ Communicate With the Organization

* Join the project’s **Slack, Discord, mailing lists, or Matrix**.
* Introduce yourself briefly: who you are, your skills, and interest in the project.
* Ask initial questions politely if something is unclear.

---

### 2️⃣ Understand the Project Deeply

* Read the **README**, **CONTRIBUTING.md**, and documentation.
* Explore the **codebase**, issues, and past PRs.
* Identify what the project does and what problems it is solving.

---

### 3️⃣ Make a Prototype or Draft

* Build a **small demo or prototype** related to your project idea.
* It can be a **minimal working version** showing your approach.
* Even a basic prototype **shows mentors you understand the project**.

---

### 4️⃣ Set Up a Meeting With Mentors

* Contact mentors after your prototype or early idea is ready.
* Explain your plan clearly:

  * What problem you want to solve
  * How you plan to implement it
  * What your timeline looks like
* Ask for **feedback and suggestions**.

---

### 5️⃣ Prepare for Contribution

* Pick **small issues** related to your project: bugs, documentation fixes, or setup improvements.
* Start contributing **before submitting your proposal** to show trustworthiness.

---

### 6️⃣ Refine Your Proposal

* Incorporate mentor feedback into your **formal GSoC proposal**.
* Link your prototype or early contributions in the proposal.
* Make sure the plan is **clear, feasible, and well-structured**.

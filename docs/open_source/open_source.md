## What Is Open Source?

Open source means that the **source code of a software is publicly available** for anyone to see, use, modify, and improve.

Instead of being controlled by a single company or individual, open-source software is **built by a community** of developers from around the world.

Key ideas behind open source:

- Source code is publicly accessible
- Anyone can read, modify, and contribute
- Development happens transparently
- Learning happens in public
- Open source is shared responsibility, not free labor

Open source is not just about code — it is about **trust, collaboration, and long-term sustainability**.

## Types of Open Source Software

Not all open source is the same. Different licenses define how software can be used.

### 1. Permissive Open Source Licenses
These licenses are very flexible.

Examples:
- MIT License
- BSD License
- Apache 2.0

What this means:
- You can use the code in personal or commercial projects
- You can modify it and even sell it
- Very few restrictions

Most startups and companies prefer permissive licenses.

---

### 2. Copyleft (Restrictive) Open Source Licenses
These licenses protect openness.

Examples:
- GPL (General Public License)
- AGPL

What this means:
- If you modify and distribute the software, your changes must also be open source
- Prevents companies from taking community work and closing it

These licenses protect freedom but limit commercial use.

### 3. Open Core Model
A mix of open and closed source.

- Core features are open source
- Advanced or enterprise features are paid

Used by many companies to sustain open-source projects.

## Why Companies Use Open Source

Companies do **not use open source because it is free**. They use it because it is **better engineering**.

### 1. Faster Development
- Companies do not reinvent the wheel
- They build on tested, battle-proven software
- Saves time and money

### 2. Higher Quality Software
- Thousands of developers review the code
- Bugs are found and fixed faster
- Security issues are caught early

### 3. Talent Attraction
- Developers trust open-source companies
- Contributors become future employees
- GitHub profile matters more than resumes

### 4. Innovation at Scale
- Open source allows global collaboration
- Best ideas win, not company hierarchy
- Rapid evolution of technology

Examples:
- Google uses Linux everywhere
- Microsoft maintains thousands of open-source projects
- Meta, Amazon, Netflix depend on open source

## Common Myths About Open Source

**Myth:** You must be an expert  
**Truth:** Most contributors are learners

**Myth:** Only coding matters  
**Truth:** Documentation, testing, design, and communication matter equally

**Myth:** Open source is unpaid work  
**Truth:** Open source builds skills that lead to paid opportunities



## Open Source and Programs Like GSoC

Programs like **Google Summer of Code** exist to:
- Support new contributors
- Fund open-source development
- Build long-term communities

GSoC is **not the goal**.  
Open source is the goal.  
GSoC is just one path.
